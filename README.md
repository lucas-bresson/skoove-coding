# Skoove Coding Challenge

## Notes

I've temporarily gave my macbook to a friend, so I developed this app on my android phone. Probably not working on iOS then. I used expo, and expo-av.

I've dedicated around 3 hours with breaks yesterday, and the same today. Overall, I estimate this is the result with a bit less than 5 hours of development.

I couldn't get to a final clean version, but unfortunately deadline is deadline! There are countless things to be improved. I usually go with the mentality "First make it work, then make it better", and it currently looks like something that just got close to work, but definitely did not get polished.

## Enhancements ideas:

-   song should stop when going back. Currently user is forced to pause the song manually or wait for it to finish before going back.
-   the way I am handling local states and params isn't ideal. I could maybe use Context to handle the ratings or so.
-   improve the general feel of the app. Right now it looks very laggy!
-   better structuration of my components, and extract small ones to their own files.
-   [...]

Thanks a lot for your time :)
